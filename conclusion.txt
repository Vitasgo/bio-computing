Biocomputers can perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. Its development can be credited to the expanding field of nanobiotechnology. Many simple biocomputers have been designed and tested, but the capabilities of these biocomputers are very limited relative to non-bio computers. It is believed that biocomputers poses great potential, but more research must be done in this emerging field.
//You could rephrase the last sentence as " Though biocomputers poses greate potiential, more research must be done to further the practicality of such devices."
